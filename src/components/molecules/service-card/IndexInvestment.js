                            Index funds and ETFs are extremely similar â€“
                            an index. The fundamental difference is ETFs
                            can be bought and sold throughout the day on
                            a stock exchange, whereas index funds trade
                            at a single valuation point. Investors can
                            choose what kind of flexibility they require
                            from an index fund, and decide which type is
                            more appropriate for their needs.
